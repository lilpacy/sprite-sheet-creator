const WALK_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 6-frame pixel art walk cycle sprite sheet of this character.

Arrange the 6 frames in a 2x3 grid (2 rows, 3 columns) on white background. The character is walking to the right.

Top row (frames 1-3):
Frame 1: Right leg forward, left leg back - stride
Frame 2: Legs very close together, passing/crossing
Frame 3: Left leg forward, right leg back - opposite stride

Bottom row (frames 4-6):
Frame 4: Legs close together, passing/crossing
Frame 5: Right leg forward again - stride
Frame 6: Legs very close together, passing/crossing

Each frame shows a different phase of the walking motion. Stride frames have legs spread apart, passing frames have legs close together.

Keep it simple like a classic 8-bit or 16-bit video game sprite. Same character design in all frames.`;

const JUMP_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art jump animation sprite sheet of this character.

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is jumping.

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Crouch/anticipation - character slightly crouched, knees bent, preparing to jump
Frame 2 (top-right): Rising - character in air, legs tucked up, arms up, ascending

Bottom row (frames 3-4):
Frame 3 (bottom-left): Apex/peak - character at highest point of jump, body stretched or tucked
Frame 4 (bottom-right): Landing - character landing, slight crouch to absorb impact

Keep it simple like a classic 8-bit or 16-bit video game sprite. Same character design in all frames. Character facing right.`;

const ATTACK_SPRITE_PROMPT = `Create a 4-frame pixel art attack animation sprite sheet of this character.

Arrange the 4 frames in a 2x2 grid on white background. The character is performing an attack that fits their design - could be a sword slash, magic spell, punch, kick, or energy blast depending on what suits the character best.

Top row (frames 1-2):
Frame 1 (top-left): Wind-up/anticipation - character preparing to attack, pulling back weapon or gathering energy
Frame 2 (top-right): Attack in motion - the strike or spell being unleashed

Bottom row (frames 3-4):
Frame 3 (bottom-left): Impact/peak - maximum extension of attack, weapon fully swung or spell at full power
Frame 4 (bottom-right): Recovery - returning to ready stance

Keep it simple like a classic 8-bit or 16-bit video game sprite. Same character design in all frames. Character facing right. Make the attack visually dynamic and exciting.`;
